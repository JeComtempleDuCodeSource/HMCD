# HI3-Manga-~~PHP~~C-Downloader
C port of [HMPD](https://github.com/JeComtempleDuCodeSource/HMPD) that uses libcURL to download books(manhua, comic call it whatever you want) from the official HI3 COMIC, CN site (https://comic.bh3.com/) and GLOBAL site (https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/).

## Why?
I wanted it to be easier to run and written in a more familiar and popular language and not mess with PHP(don't get me wrong it is a not that bad language but this is not a web site and i have no plans for it).

Today everything needs internet and that is pretty annoying one my biggest complain about HI3 (and so many other games) would be the fact that it needs constant internet connection, and also game file encryption, if suddenly miHoYo shutdown or this game is blocked you can say goodbye to HI3!\
Sooo i wrote a script to download HI3 Manhuas and download them on whatever device that supports libCURL you want Windows, GNU-Linux or Android through Termux.\
So that we can at least keep this part of HI3!

## How to get it
Just got [there](https://github.com/JeComtempleDuCodeSource/HMCD/releases).

## Build
To build you'll need git, cmake, libcURL and a C compiler and then just run the bash/batch scripts.
