# HI3-Manga-~~PHP~~C-Downloader
C port of [HMPD](https://github.com/JeComtempleDuCodeSource/HMPD) that uses libcURL(see LIBCURL.COPYING.txt) to download books(manhua if you prefer) from the official HI3 COMIC, CN site (https://comic.bh3.com/) and GLOBAL site (https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/).

## Why?
I wanted it to be easier to run and written in a more familiar and popular language and not mess with PHP(don't get me wrong it is a not that bad language but this is not a web site and i have no plans for it).

Today everything needs internet and that is pretty annoying one my biggest complain about HI3 and Genshin would be the fact that it needs constant internet connection, and also game file encryption, but what if suddenly miHoYo shutdown or this game is blocked? Well... you can say bye bye to HI3 and Genshin!\
Sooo i wrote a script to download HI3 Manhuas and download them on whatever device that supports libCURL you want Windows, GNU-Linux or Android through Termux.\
So that we can at least keep this part of HI3!
